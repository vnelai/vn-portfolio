            <h2>üìù Featured Blog: Self-Taught with Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              From hospital hallways to the front lines of digital defense, I
              transitioned from healthcare to cybersecurity with zero tech
              background ‚Äî just grit, purpose, and a hunger to protect. This
              post unpacks how I went from learning IT basics to earning
              multiple certs, diving into code, and securing real-world systems.
              If you're navigating your own self-taught journey or curious how
              coding and cyber connect, this one's for you.

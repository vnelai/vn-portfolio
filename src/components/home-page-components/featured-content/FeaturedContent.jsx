            <h2>üöÄ Featured Project: Reviving an Old MacBook with Linux</h2>
            <p>
              Took an end-of-life MacBook and turned it into a secure Linux
              laptop. Fought through a corrupted USB, Broadcom Wi-Fi driver
              headaches, and kernel compatibility. Then landed on Ubuntu MATE
              22.04.3 for a clean, stable fix. Great for learners, homelabs, and
              cyber pros who value practicality over hype.

            <h2>üìù Featured Blog: Self-Taught with Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              From hospital hallways to the front lines of digital defense, I
              transitioned from healthcare to cybersecurity with zero tech
              background, just grit, purpose, and a hunger to protect. This post
              unpacks how I went from learning IT basics to earning multiple
              certs, diving into code, and securing real-world systems. If
              you're navigating your own self-taught journey or curious how
              coding and cyber connect, this one's for you.

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">From Caring for Patients to Defending Systems: My Journey Into Cybersecurity</h2>

  <p>I discovered cybersecurity while working in a leadership role, collaborating with professionals focused on protecting our systems and data. Watching them in action — hardening devices, educating users, and fighting off digital threats — lit a fire in me. I realized I wanted to be on the front lines too, defending organizations and users from cyber threats.</p>

  <p>Then came the United Healthcare breach. I saw firsthand how damaging a cyberattack could be — not just to systems, but to people. That experience lit something in me. I’ve always had a bit of a superhero complex — a drive to protect people, especially when they’re vulnerable or under threat. Healthcare gave me one way to do that, but I realized tech could give me a whole new set of powers. With the right skills, I could fight back against digital threats and help keep people safe in a world that’s only getting more connected.</p>

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">Building My Foundation in Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>I started from zero. No tech background, just raw passion and determination. My journey began with foundational IT knowledge: learning how computers work, exploring operating systems, understanding file systems, memory, hardware, and more.</p>

  <p>I earned my CompTIA ITF+ and A+, which gave me solid footing in technical basics and troubleshooting. From there, I leveled up with the Network+, because networking is the bloodstream of cybersecurity. Learning how systems communicate — from TCP/IP to the OSI model — gave me a new respect for the complexity behind sending even one bit of data across the web.</p>

  <p>Then came the real fun: Security+. That’s where everything clicked. I dove into the world of cyber threats — from social engineering tactics to network vulnerabilities. I learned how firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, MFA, and hashing all work together to build layered defenses. Security+ opened my eyes to how deep and essential cybersecurity really is.</p>

  <p>The biggest takeaway? The weakest link in any company is its people. No matter how secure the infrastructure is, one careless click can bring down an empire. And hackers know this. That’s why the most important defense isn’t just technical — it’s human. Security awareness and training are just as critical as firewalls and encryption.</p>

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">Why I Learned to Code</h2>
  <p>Right after Security+, I was accepted into a 15-week, full-time Software Engineering Bootcamp. It was a turning point. I knew that many cyber attacks are web-based — so understanding code, full-stack systems, and how applications function under the hood was non-negotiable.</p>

  <p>I went in with curiosity and graduated valedictorian from pre scholas. In over 500+ hours of hands-on coding, I learned how to build full-stack apps, work with APIs, manage databases, and design secure systems. The ability to build gave me a new superpower. Now, I don’t just know how to secure systems — I know how they’re made.</p>

  <p>Software engineering gave me a competitive edge in cybersecurity. Knowing how code flows, how logic breaks, how backends handle data — these skills are essential when thinking like an attacker or defending like a pro.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">Cloud Security and Next Steps</h2>
  <p>As I continued learning, I realized how much of today’s infrastructure lives in the cloud. Businesses are rapidly migrating for good reason — scalability, cost-efficiency, and enhanced flexibility. I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and began studying cloud architecture and security. My next goal: the AWS Security Specialty.</p>

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">Hands-On Practice and Real-World Projects</h2>
  <p>I don’t just learn in theory — I practice. I’ve been sharpening my skills through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TryHackMe labs and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges</li>
    <li>Setting up my own home lab with Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>Exploring Hack The Box, OverTheWire, and BlueTeam Labs Online</li>
    <li>Volunteering tech support and cybersecurity guidance to people and small businesses in my network</li>
    <li>Taking on freelance gigs where I’ve provided cybersecurity consulting, vulnerability scanning, and website security enhancements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Through these experiences, I’ve helped businesses build secure websites, scan for vulnerabilities, and clean up risky configurations. My advice to other self-taught learners and bootcamp grads? Tap into your network. Offer your services, build trust, and let your results speak for themselves. People will come back — and refer you — if you deliver.</p>

  <h2 class="article-subtitle">What’s Next</h2>
  <p>I’m still learning. Still building. And now, I’m writing.</p>

  <p>I’ve always loved writing, and this blog is a way for me to share my journey, my knowledge, and practical tips to help others stay safe online. My mission is simple: educate users to reduce the attack surface, one post at a time.</p>

  <p>So if you’re into cybersecurity, tech growth, or just want to learn how to protect yourself in a digital world — stick around. We’re just getting started.</p>
